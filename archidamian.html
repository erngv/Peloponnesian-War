            <p>
                The first phase of the Peloponnesian War was the Archidamian War, took place between 431 B.C.
                and 421 B.C.. Its name comes after the Spartan king at the time, Archidamus, who devised a
                unique strategy to draw the Athens into the fight. However, Pericles (the leader of Athens) did
                not want to fight, given that the Athenians had the Piraeus and the Long Wall and the Spartans
                simply did not have the resources to attack the naval port nor to tear down the walls.

                Since neither side wanted to start a war in the first place, nor either side had a winning
                strategy, Sparta proposed to Athens to let Aegina lead the Delian League, give them back its
                autonomy, and to cancel the Megarian Decree. Obviously, Athens refused! This kept going back
                and forth for years, until a plague spread throughout Athens and Cleon came to power. Because of
                the disease, Sparta stopped going north to raid Attica, and started raiding Athens's allies, such
                as the city of Plataea, where the Spartans murdered everyone. In 425 B.C., 120 Spartans are captured
                by the Athenians in the island of Sphacteria, and these threatened to kill them all if Sparta ever set
                foot in Attica again. In 421 B.C., a guy called Nicias came out with a truce, known as the Peace of
                Nicias.
                The peace treaty put an end to this first phase of the war by asking for three conditions: the Spartan
                prisoners would be returned, Athens would give up the Plataea and gain a port city in Megara, and
                everything
                would return to the status quote it was before, meaning that up to this point the Peloponnesian War had
                solved
                nothing. Then <b>Alcibiades</b> came into play!
