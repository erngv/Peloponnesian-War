                Lysander was was an un-Spartan Spartan. He was great in the military aspect, but he was also a
                great politician and diplomat. He also served as Alcibiades replacement in Sparta and got much
                more money from Persia. In 406 B.C., he even outsmarted Athens by bringing up ships to the
                Athenian fleet, tricking them into fighting while Alcibiades was away. The Battle of Notium took
                place and Sparta won; Athens lost 22 ships. When Alcibiades returned, he knew he was going to be
                blamed for this loss, so he decided to take off once again. He was not wrong, but since he was not
                present Athenian admirals Theramenes and Thrasybulus were exiled instead.

            <p>
                Lysander realized that blocking the Hellespont was indeed a good idea. Then, the Battle of Aegospotamai
                took place, Sparta won and the war ended. Athens lost 150 ships and 3,000 Athenian soldiers were taken
                and executed. That same year, Lysander blocked the Athenians at sea, and Pausanias, the Spartan king,
                besieged the city of Athens by land with his army. Athens had to surrender on Spartan terms:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tear down all its walls and disband the entire army.</li>
                <li>Disband all of its ships; they were allowed to keep only twelve.</li>
                <li>Forced to follow Spartan foreign policy.</li>
                <li>Dissolved democracy and accept oligarchy.</li>
            </ul>
