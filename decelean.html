            <p>
                After Alcibiades fled to Sparta, Nicias was left alone, and he decided they needed to attack
                someone, Syracuse. However, Syracuse appealed to his ally, Sparta, and Sparta sent one man:
                Gylippus, an old Spartan general who helped the Syracusians organize and defend themselves. The
                Athenians
                lost embarrassingly, and the entire Athenian force was either captured or killed. As a result, many
                members
                of the Delian League revolted and Sparta redeclared war to Athens, beginning the second phase of the
                Peloponnesian War.
                The Decelean War lasted from 413 B.C. to 404 B.C. Sparta, however, had a different strategy this time
                thanks to
                Alcibiades. They took over a small city called Decelea and made it a permanent Spartan base. Alcibiades
                also suggested
                them to create a navy to defeat Athens, which led them to made a deal with Persia for money in exchange
                of Ionia. In the
                meantime, Athens was desperately trying to build up their fleet, but they ere not interested in the
                political trouble. Therefore,
                a group of wealthy people in Athens overthrew democracy and reinstalled oligarchy in 411 B.C., with
                plans to surrender the city to
                Sparta. Eventually, however, democrats took over again.

            <p>
                The Spartan navy, following Alcibiadesâ€™ advice, brought their navy and blocked the Hellespont (a narrow,
                65 kilometer water passage
                between the Aegean Sea and the Sea of Marmara). Suddenly, the Athenians began to win a variety of naval
                victories; they even destroyed
                the Hellespont blockade. Then, Sparta proposed the Athenians a truce but these refused; they wanted to
                keep the war going. Sparta had no
                choice but to ask Persia for more money. Then <b>Lysander</b> came into play!
